This is a quick guide to installing NekRS and Ascent.
Ascent is linked only when compiling the case UDF, so thereâ€™s nothing to do
during installation.
On HPC (Frontier, Aurora and Polaris), simply load the module afterwards.

## Version

- NekRS v24-dev, https://github.com/Nek5000/nekRS/tree/v24-development
- Ascent XXX TODO

## Workflow

We will use ALCF/Aurora as an example. You can skip this if you already have a
NekRS installtion (with or without ascent module).

1. Install NekRS with modules from `nekrs/scripts`.      

   To recap, on Aurora
   a. Get nekrs. Can be at Home or Project Work.  
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/Nek5000/NekRS.git nekrs_repo_v24dev
     cd nekrs_repo_v24dev
     git checkout v24-development
     ```

   b. Load modules
     ```
     module load cmake
     
     # Not required for compilation, but will use later
     module use /soft/modulefiles/
     module load ascent/develop/2025-03-19-c1f63e7-openmp
     ```

     As a sanity check, XXX

   c. Set installation path. Modify it correspondingly.
     ```
     export NEKRS_HOME=/lus/flare/projects/EnergyApps/ylan/.local/nekrs_repo_v24dev
     ```

   d. Compile
     ```
     CC=mpicc CXX=mpic++ FC=mpif77 ./build.sh \
              -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${NEKRS_HOME}
     ```

   b and c are required every login.

2. Add Ascent environment into submit script

   This is already done. Search `USE_ASCENT` in `$NEKRS_HOME/bin/nrsqaub_aurora`.


## Ascent on different machines

### HPC

On `ALCF/Aurora`, `ALCF/Polaris` and `OLCF/Frontier`, the environment has been
set inside the submit script and can be activated by `USE_ASCENT=1`.

For other machines, one has to specify `NEKRS_ASCENT_INSTALL_DIR` for NekRS to
link the library at runtime (pre-compilation). `NEKRS_MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE=1` is
required for async mode.  We will talk about it when discussing the performance.

### Local

This is not recommended in general. Because using docker on Mac could be tricky
and installing Ascent from scratch can easily take hours. There is also extra
complexity if one wants to try different Ascent backends. Here, we simply leave
resources to start with.

- Docker    
  See the tutorial from ascent's [doc](https://ascent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorial_Setup.html)
  
- Install from scratch   
  See the tutorial from ascent's [doc](https://ascent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/QuickStart.html#installing-ascent-and-third-party-dependencies). We only need the CPU/OpenMP backend to run.
  GPU is not required.
